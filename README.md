# Brain-Tumor
Using MRI brain imaging, we can predict the likelihood of a brain tumor.

In this code, we aim to predict with high accuracy the presence or absence of brain tumor in MRI images using two directories containing images with and without brain tumors. This is accomplished through the use of image processing technology and machine learning algorithms.

Please add your images to YES and NO directories for use in classifying images with and without brain tumors. I have used the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection for my project.
